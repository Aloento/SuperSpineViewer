### Information & About

It's essentially a practice piece for me to learn Java and OpenJFX  
While I try to make sure it works as well as possible  
I can't guarantee that it will work well or have most of the features

This tool uses the highly customizable Spine Runtime  
Spine Universal LibGDX Runtimes

### Bugs

The current rendering implementation takes up a lot of unnecessary RAM  
Will try to migrate when DriftFX is stable  
Currently requires system support for Pixel Buffers

If this appears [(This is actually a bug in the JDK)](https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8192647)  
`[warning][gc,alloc] SavePNG: Retried waiting for GCLocker too often allocating %d words`  
Then it means that there is a problem during **GC**  
In this case, frames will be **lost** and **lagged**  
and FFmpeg will get stuck when processing  
This can only be solved by restarting the program  
Please adjust the JVM parameters to allow more memory allocation  
Or reduce the **Resolution** or **Quality** and improve the **Performance**

### Performance Settings Reference

* High Resolution (Camera) = High Memory Requirements
* Quality = Exponentially Higher Memory Requirements
* Performance = Higher CPU Requirements, But Memory Usage Decreases As Performance Increases

**RAM**:

    4G+ = Extreme (240FPS)
    3G~ = Standard (120FPS)
    2G~ = Fast (60FPS)

**CPU**

    High-End = High (12)
    General = Normal (6)
    Mobile = Low (3)

### Sequence Usage Reference

Take importing After Effects as an example  
At default 30FPS, the Time Scaling setting

    Extreme = 800%
    Standard = 400%
    Fast = 200%
